        <p class ="lead">After returning home from Limon two years ago, I knew I had left behind a piece of my heart.  The children were so friendly and welcoming.  Within minutes they were striking up conversation, braiding my hair, and holding my hand.  When I returned home, I was in search of a way to motivate the kids to read with a positive excited attitude.  I designed the kindle project in order to create a cool enticing aura around reading. Returning to Limon and the library this summer, I realized the true impact of the kindles as teenagers who would usually not visit the library had started reading and were involved in 'book clubs'. I am already looking forward to the next exciting project with my new community.</p>
