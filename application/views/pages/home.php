        <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Mission: Literacy in Limon</h2>
        <p class="lead"> The problem of childhood illiteracy in Limon, Nicaragua has a startlingly identifiable cause: There are no books. In order to fulfill my mission of bringing literacy to the community, I created an e-reader based program to create curiosity and sustain interest in kids who lack engaging materials. I have raised funds and shipped Kindles filled with countless Spanish e-books to the community library. These e-readers have created an exciting enticing reading experience for the teens of Limon. From the moment the e-readers arrived in the community, teenagers gathered to form book clubs; they wanted to read and they wanted to share what they were learning. Please join me in my mission by clicking to make a donation, clicking to donate a book, or SHARING your own e-book for free!</p>

        <p class="lead">My name is Leora Katzman. I live in New Jersey and I am a student at The Ramaz Upper School in New York City. Some of my interests include basketball, softball, skiing, squash, creative writing and photography. Most importantly, I have always been fascinated by travel and community service. I have traveled widely within Central and South America; visiting Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru. I recognize that the world is much larger than the Northeast Coast of The United States and that much can be learned from distinct communities around the globe.</p>
